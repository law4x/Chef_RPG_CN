"Uriel_interaction1_1","Nice to see you again, (playername). Still getting adjusted to life in White Ash Harbor?_It's a slower pace than Billboard City, but you'll get used to it.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction1_2","I wish you had seen this town in its prime. What a sight it was and it didn't reek of fish! Blegh!","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction1_3","Have you ever tried dry aged meat? The flavor is out of this world.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction1_4","I wonder where I would've been if . . . Sorry! You caught me talking to myself! Hope your day is a solid one.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction1_5","Most people prefer the sun, but I like myself a cool rainy day. It really calms me.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction1_6","A good sense of direction will get you home in no time. It's a skill to develop, sure, but once you have it you'll never feel lost again.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"Uriel_interaction2_1_intro","Can I tell you something? I've been living my dreams for the last fifteen years and this butcher shop is it. Not many people can say that._Passion and dreams are what's needed in life. What are your dreams for Le Sequoia?","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction2_1_option_1","I have a lot of plans in my head. We'll see what works!","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction2_1_option_2","I don't know just yet, this is all new to me.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction2_1_response_1","As does any owner of an establishment, but planning without action won't keep the lights on._You have to work for it. I mean, reeeallly work for it!","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction2_1_response_2","Understandable, but if Chef Casteau gave it to you, he must have seen something to trust.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction2_2","I promise my meat is sourced ethically. At some point it had a name, breathed air, and saw sky._You should always eat something that had a name. It's how you know people cared for it.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction2_3","I make sure I get the best meat for my customers. Getting cheaper meat to sell isn't the point of this shop._We're here to provide the best because my customers are the best.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction2_4","Standards matter in this business. If people see you are doing things to a high degree, they come out and support you.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction2_5","I will never take advantage of people's trust._Trust is the most valuable currency and should never be spent or taken lightly.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction2_6","When I was a boy, I used to go exploring in the woods when I wasn't on my grandfather's fishing boat._Used to hear all sorts of odd things out there. Whispers in the trees and such. Pretty creepy.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"Uriel_interaction3_1_intro","You ever notice it's the small things in life that really make the day? Like, getting the knife in the joint and popping it is just so satisifying._Do you get that feeling from butchering meat?","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction3_1_option_1",". . . what?","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction3_1_option_2",". . . yes, I get this feeling.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction3_1_response_1","Well, it's simply a joy to feel, to me that is.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction3_1_response_2","Right?! It's such a satisfying sound. Hearing it reminds me that my time spent learning this trade has paid off.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction3_2","Have you talked to Bowie yet? He's my grandfather! He has some amazing stories to tell. I learned about a curing technique that they use overseas from him._Only have six more months of waiting to see if it worked.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction3_3","When I get a chance to chat, I take it, because this place is my second home._Only instead of couches there's slabs of meat. Almost like home.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction3_4","When it's raining, I like to zone out for a moment._Rain always makes me forget about my world for just a moment, but then I snap back to the meat in my hands and the knife cutting into it.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction3_5","What's a break? Haha! When you own your business there are no breaks on this train, am I right? Haha . . . ha.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction3_6","I never understood why La Galarie is in French. The furniture's nice, sure, but why is everything that's fancy seen as French?_The French also eat cooked snails. Is that fancy? Yes, because it's French! See, propoganda can get anyone.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"Uriel_interaction4_1_intro","Hey (playername), ever feel like you're being pulled in a bunch of directions?_That you are burned out even though things are going well?","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction4_1_option_1","There are days, yeah. Work is hard.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction4_1_option_2","No, I know what I am doing and where I am heading.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction4_1_response_1","Yeah, like Hasel is an android who always gives it her all and never feels worn out. She's chipper and makes amazing drinks._I try to stay positive, but there are days when that isn't the case, and they feel like they're happening more often.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction4_1_response_2","Must be nice to feel that way. This shop is a success, and I enjoy the work, but I often wonder if I should try something else for a bit? Maybe be a painter?","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction4_2","Pomarine gave birth to 12 kids, raised them, and fed them even after her husband left her and the children._How she was able to adapt to such adversity is beyond me, but it led to her being the best hunter in White Ash Harbor.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction4_3","Part of me, even now, feels like I am waiting for all of this to fall flat._For people to see that what I am is really just a lie. I know it won't happen, but I believe it will.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction4_4","Sorry for venting so much earlier. I'm okay! I . . . I just need to unwind._It's been busy. So busy . . .","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction4_5","I joked about how this place is my second home, but truthfully, I haven't gone home in four days._I've been that slammed and I don't know if what I'm doing is . . . anyway, don't fret, I'm good.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction4_6","Maybe I should take a walk on the beach sometime . . . there's always something to look at and enjoy there.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"Uriel_interaction5_1_intro","Do you think I cut up people's bodies and sell them as prime cuts?","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction5_1_option_1","Uhhhh, no! Not at all?","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction5_1_option_2","Uriel, you know I trust you, but sometimes you say things that really sound . . . bad.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction5_1_response_1","That was the least convincing 'no' I have ever heard. You want to know the truth? I don't, but I let everyone think that I do._Hasn't hurt business at all . . . which is odd.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction5_1_response_2","And I trust you. I trust you enough to let you know the truth . . . I don't cut up people. I let everyone think that so I don't get pushed around. It hasn't hurt my business, which is odd.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction5_2","Maybe I should name my cuts of meat? Like, 'Today we have five Susan cuts and twenty Fredrick cuts' or something? On second thought, maybe not, too many questions.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction5_3","I was walking to the shop the other day and I saw someone making paper airplanes at on a bench in the forest._She was just sitting there, folding, and throwing these planes. Must have been a hundred scattered around her.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction5_4","My entire family is into fish. They fish it, sell it, make recipes for it. Me? I can't stand the smell of it._Couldn't get into it, so I figured, being a butcher was the next best thing since I'd developed my knife skills on my family boat.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction5_5","Getting together with my dad is fun, I enjoy him, but truth be told, we have some friction there still._He and mom haven't been completely happy about my choice to deal in land based proteins. Makes Thanksgiving awkward, you know?","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction5_6","I'm glad that we talk, you know. Chatting with you helps me forget some of the more dreadful things in my life_ I think a lot of people wrestle with the choices they've made. I know I have, but having a friend like you makes it bearable.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"Uriel_interaction6_1_intro","Good morning, my filet minion!_I am going to save some amazing cuts of beef for us.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction6_1_option_1","Oh, you don't have to do that for me!","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction6_1_option_2","Mmmm, that sounds lovely.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction6_1_response_1","It isn't a matter of have to, I want to. I want to treat us to the finest I can find because we deserve that.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction6_1_response_2","There's a New York strip I have aging right now that will be amazing in a few weeks.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction6_2","Since we've been together, I have started to see life as something that isn't my job._I have started to see the many layers that it can have and I want to see it all with you.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction6_3","I hope that we go the distance because I really think what we have here is very special.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction6_4","I'll probably never stop working because I enjoy what I do so much, but I will never allow my job to come between us. Never.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction6_5","I'm trying to not jump ahead of anything . . . But . . ._. . . But when we're old, and it's the end of the day, I'd like to just have some tea and hold your hand while the day unwinds.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_interaction6_6","I know we're together, but I am going to lay this out for you: I don't expect you to give up your dreams for me._I hope I just get to be there to see you shine.","xxxx",,,,

"Uriel_progression_luciusReview","I read Lucius' review of your food. Your food is great and everyone here agrees._I don't care if he liked it or not, critics shouldn't have that much power over people's minds!","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_progression_bathhouseOpen","Great job getting the bathhouse up and running again._That took some guts! I always heard it was huanted, not that I believe in ghosts because if I did then I'd be in trouble in my line of work, haha! Well done!","xxxx",,,,

"Uriel_restaurantMenu_positive_2","That menu you got at Le Sequioa is very exciting. I cannot wait to try what you're making with my meat!","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_restaurantMenu_negative_1","I dunno about your menu right now, it feels really . . . off. It needs more meat options, in my own opinion.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_restaurantMenu_negative_2","I don't think I'm going to eat at your restaurant right now. The menu isn't sitting well with me at the moment.","xxxx",,,,

"Uriel_environmentConsumer_negative_1","I really cannot stress how much I hate the trash floating around here._If it makes its way into the livestock, I cannot promise that the quality of the meat won't go down.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_environmentConsumer_negative_2","If we don't get a handle on all of this pollution soon, I will have to resort to alternate forms of protein, and trust me, you don't want that happening.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"Uriel_firstQuestComplete_1","(playername), thanks for the help again with that delivery. I really need to remember it's okay to ask for help, even when it's not an emergency.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_firstQuestComplete_2","Looking at the ocean the other day was really relaxing, because it felt like I wasn't there for a moment, and it was peaceful.","xxxx",,,,

"Uriel_secondQuestComplete_2","After realizing that making my life about work wasn't living, I decided to try some hobbies._I tried the usual ones like making a ship in a bottle, knitting, but they weren't doing it. I almost gave up, until I discovered . . .dance! I love it.","xxxx",,,,
"Uriel_secondQuestComplete_3","It's funny, I really wouldn't be where I am mentally without your help. Life doesn't need a drastic change all the time._Small things we can do for ourselves is really what's needed more often than not. For the last time, probably not, thanks.","xxxx",,,,

"April_interaction5_1_response_2","I foresaw that you would be a little hesitant._It's your nature to be humble, but you've done a lot for me, so carving a likeness of the forest alter from jade to cleanse your spirit is the least I can do.","xxxx",,,,

"April_interaction6_1_option_2","Could, you at least see some lotto numbers?","xxxx",,,,
"April_interaction6_1_response_1","For us, I will keep the playing field level. I shouldn't know more than you when it comes to our relationship.","xxxx",,,,
"April_interaction6_1_response_2","Hahaha! (playername)! I could never do such a thing. Also, all gambling outcomes are blocked by the powers that be for VERY obvious reasons.","xxxx",,,,
"April_interaction6_2","I really hope when we've been together for long enough that I will never know all of you._Sure, I'll know how you like your coffee or your favorite color, but I want to keep finding things or trying to decipher pieces of you.","xxxx",,,,
"April_interaction6_3","Last night I received a vision! We will have something wonderful happen to us very soon!_I know I said I wouldn't use my gift for us, but this wasn't something I actively did. It just happened! Ahhh! I can't wait to see what it is!","xxxx",,,,
"April_interaction6_4","The future is uncertain, even when I do my readings, because it relies on the person who is here today to make it happen._And they have to want to make it happen. I hope our future is bright, because I want it for us.","xxxx",,,,
"April_interaction6_5","Out of all the readings I've done, there is one I will never forget._I had this young woman in front of me, I opened myself to the universe, and I saw nothing for her._I have never told anyone that before. I just hope she's okay.","xxxx",,,,

"Nacim_interaction4_1_option_2","I really have to go.","xxxx",,,,

"Nacim_interaction5_1_response_2","Yeah, that's probably the solution.","xxxx",,,,
"Nacim_interaction5_2","I've been trying to figure out why my reading has been dropping off, and I think it's because it was something I did with Allison._Now that it's just me, I'd rather play a game or watch a show. Is it strange that I feel guilty?","xxxx",,,,
"Nacim_interaction5_3","I'll never forget when I took Aminata to the playground when she was a solo child._There was a kid there that tried to push her out of the way of the slide, and by out of the way, I mean over the edge. Kids are mini sociopaths.","xxxx",,,,
"Nacim_interaction5_4","Prisca has done a lot for me. When I first lost Allison, she made sure I got free daycare until Aminata could go to school and a week off of work for grief._It was amazing and needed since daycare could've easily taken my entire paycheck.","xxxx",,,,

"AnnaMay_interaction1_2","Oh, hi again. Hope you're having a good day.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction1_3","You're new here, right? I know most of the people in White Ash Harbor, so you stick out like a rotten potato._Not that you're rotten, but you're noticeable. Take it easy.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction1_4","I am Anna-May, dunno why I didn't say that last time. My family owns Takashi Farms and we grow lots of crops._Some organic, some industrial sized, you know, varied amounts.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction1_5","So, you're the new owner of the Sequoia? . . . Don't get creeped out, it's a small town, so word gets around pretty fast about anything new.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction1_6","White Ash Harbor is a small town, so the nightlife here isn't the best, but I would recommend Bea's Bar._It's pretty noticeable, but it's also one of the only places in town for late night fun. Take that as you will.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction2_1_intro","What are your thoughts of White Ash Harbor so far?","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction2_1_option_1","It's a cute small town.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction2_1_option_2","I miss hustle and bustle of Billboard City.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction2_1_response_1","Small doesn't begin to describe this town is.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction2_1_response_2","You're from Billboard City and you decided to come here? To this town by the sea, away from the big city?","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction2_2","I couldn't imagine leaving such a place like Billboard City to come here. I mean, what an odd thing to do. You sure you're okay in the head?","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction2_3","The culture in White Ash Harbor is stale to put it lightly. No art scene at all and making connections into that world is difficult at a distance.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction2_4","My sister, Mae-Lou, loves this place, and I do too, but I just . . . it's not filling my cup anymore.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction2_5","It's hard to think that for a lot of people here, that this is it for them, and they're okay with that. I wish I could do that too.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction2_6","I think I am going to do a public art piece involving the payphones._They are such a relic of the past that somehow has survived until now. I find them just fascinating.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction3_1_intro","Do you feel the weight of the Sequoia's legacy around your neck at all?_It heard was a lively spot back in the day.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction3_1_option_1","Every. Day. They are big shoes to fill.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction3_1_option_2","No. Chef Casteau believes in me.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction3_1_response_1","One rule when it comes to legacy: It doesn't have to keep going. It just hurts if your the one who ends it.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction3_1_response_2","Making it your own . . . but you at least have an interest in the work to be done. Enough that you're going to make it your own. Must be nice to be that free.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction3_2","You went to cooking school, right? Like, you chose your profession. It wasn't handed down to each generation whether they liked it or not. You got a choice.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction3_3","It wasn't like your father's father's father started a business you have to run now and if you hate it you're being the bad guy, right?_I'm . . . I'm not speaking from experience except that I am speaking . . . from experience.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction3_4","I know a lot of people would rather live somewhere with sunshine happening 24/7, but I don't._I like that I have seasons and get to experience all their splendor and bother. Otherwise, it's just boring, ya know?","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction3_5","I want Takashi Farms to thrive, but, I just want it to thrive without me.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction3_6","A place I always loved visiting when I needed some alone time was and always will be the library._It's a fantastic space that gives me what I need: Air that doesn't smell like compost.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction4_1_intro","You know what I really want out of life? To make art and make a living off of it.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction4_1_option_1","Why not go for it then?","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction4_1_option_2","You could still make art in your free time.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction4_1_response_1","It's hard to break away from something that your parents believe will take care of you long after they're gone. And you kinda believe it too.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction4_1_response_2","No half-measures, (playername). If I treat what I want in life a 'fun little thing I get to do' it will forever be a small thing. It will never grow.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction4_2","I have always loved creating art. I often use the animals around the farm as inspiration for many of my pieces._Its just, making a living from it is hard. If I don't go for it, if I don't go now, I will forever wonder what could have been?","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction4_3","I do not want to end up like some of the people here. Trapped in a shell I never made.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction4_4","I love my family, but it's been difficult for them to understand just why I want to do art as a venture._'It's hard', they say. So is harvesting an entire field of crops!","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction4_5","I have made some connections in Billboard City from the art shows I've done here in town._Maybe . . . maybe I should go for it. Mae-Lou gets why I should do it and that's good enough for me!","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction4_6","When I'm a big time artist in Billboard City, there is one place I know I will miss, and that's the wharf._It's a bit of a contradiction because I don't like the beach all that much, but I love the sound of the wood planks at the warf under my shoes.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction5_1_intro","Do you follow esports at all? It's something of a hobby of mine.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction5_1_option_1","No, not really something I'm interested in.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction5_1_option_2","I would be intrigued in checking it out. I've heard a lot about it.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction5_1_response_1","A lot like art, it's not for everyone, and I understand that. I don't agree with it, but I understand it.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction5_1_response_2","Oh my goodness, then you must watch the Fathom of Myths playoffs! They are happening soon and I think you would love it!","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction5_2","I dunno if this is true for you, but when I am painting, I feel lost in my work._Not that I am directionless, more like nothing else matters around me when I am in front of that canvas or drawing pad.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction5_3","I'll never forget when I was little and I pulled this carrot from the ground and the carrot looked like a face!_Mae-Lou teased me, saying that it was how I was going to look when I am old! Jokes on her, we're twins, she's going wrinkly with me!","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction5_4","I have been selling some pieces lately! Seeing people really connect with my work has been such a boost._It . . . it shows that I'm worth it. I'm worth trying this new thing out.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction5_5","You probably already know this, but doing something on your own is scary._Your restaurant is raving now, but when you first got here, I'm sure you felt shaky._Maybe you still do? I don't think that feeling really goes away.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction5_6","I really admire the amount of courage you had to come here and re-open Le Sequoia._It takes grit to go after something as hard as you have even though it might not pan out. You're pretty inspo, (playername).","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction6_1_intro","Look, I really like you, a lot, but . . ._. . . But I am never going to ask your opinion on an art piece I am making.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction6_1_option_1","I get it!","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction6_1_option_2","Why not? I got eyes.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction6_1_response_1","Exactly, I won't expect you to ask me to give you notes on a dish you're trying out._I might hate it, but it might be a big hit with everyone else, but if you take my note to heart you'll never know. Same goes for my art.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction6_1_response_2","And I got a mouth, but that doesn't mean I'll like everything you make in the kitchen and that might derail any chance of a cool dish being made._I respect you, but your eyes probably won't understand what I've painted on my canvas.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction6_2","We're both professionals, and I will respect your work as much as you respect mine._But let's both remember to relax with one another still, okay? Good.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction6_3","Since we've been together, my mind has been able to find new material I never knew I had waiting inside. You make me my best me.","xxxx",,,,
"AnnaMay_interaction6_4","I have had relationships in the past, but this, us, feels different. It doesn't feel like it's going to end in three months or something._I feels like it will grow and keep on growing. I love that idea.","xxxx",,,,

"AnnaMay_environmentConsumer_positive_1","Way to keep your ventures growing without trashing our environment! As a farmer, artist, and resident here, believe me when I say we all appreciate it.","xxxx",,,,

"MaeLou_interaction5_1_response_2","I get that. What helps me is goal setting. If I can check that item on my list, I feel like I've done something worthwhile. It's simple, but it works.","xxxx",,,,
"MaeLou_interaction5_2","My dad asked me to check and see why the farm's computer was running so slow._I opened it up, and wow, I haven't seen that much dust and feathers inside a space since one of our pillows exploded during pretty nasty pillow fight.","xxxx",,,,
"MaeLou_interaction5_3","Farmers are the kind of folks who would rather lose their arm to a auger than give up. Farmers are a hopeful lot, I give us that.","xxxx",,,,

"Bowie_interaction1_2","(playername), if you think the fishing here is great, then you've never been to Reddington! It's a small little town, but the fish they catch are the size of buses!","xxxx",,,,

"Bowie_interaction5_6","Our lives always involve the lives of others._What we do isn't just for us but for people we will never meet._Being old, I look at my clothes and think about who will wear them one day when I'm not here. It's nice to think about, really.","xxxx",,,,

"Fleur_interaction2_1_option_1","I'm going to knock Otto Canton down a peg on The 100.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction2_1_option_2","I need to show people that my successes are my own alone and not due to parterning with the names of others.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction2_1_response_1","You're going to climb over Canton's shop? Good luck to you then.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction2_1_response_2","Classic imposter syndrome, but I get the need to want to prove yourself on your terms. Wish I had that opportunity, but I'm just happy to run a successful business. - Change to not mention Bobby- Adjusted","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction2_2","Traveler's sits comfortably in the 50s on The 100 and I am proud of that. This place has been here for thirty years and it's my turn at the wheel. God help me.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction2_3","One of the main drawbacks to this spot is that there is very little I can do to make it my own because our clientele knows us and knows what they like and change isn't on the menu.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction2_4","We've been in that 53 spot for a long time. We haven't gone up or down. Some people might be accepting of that, but me, I want to push us up just a bit.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction2_5","Just . . . trying anything to help us move up The 100 feels like we would risk going down too. It's hard to move out of quick sand when every twitch could save or kill you just the same.","xxxx",,,,

"Fleur_interaction3_1_option_2","I do, why?","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction3_1_response_1","Don't fret, you're not my type, I have a girlfriend, but she's far away. I was curious to see how you handle long distance stuff, but I got my answer.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction3_1_response_2","Good for you! I gotta ask though, how do you do it? The long distance thing? I ask because I have a girlfriend who lives in Neon Foundry. I know, far away, but we love each other.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction3_2","I met Remy at a restaurateurs conference. She runs a hippy dippy vegan spot in the Art Tunnel of Neon Foundry, has an eyebrow piercing, and wouldn't usually be my type, but in that moment, she was.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction3_3","Remy has this ability to make me forget all of my stresses from Traveler's. When I call her, everything vanishes, and I just feel . . . oh no! I have to get those restocks done now!","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction3_4","I want to be with her, (playername). Every moment I am awake, and it's hard because I can't leave Traveler's on a whim to see her. Not these days.","xxxx",,,,

"Fleur_interaction4_1_option_2","This is a question? You are seriously asking me this? Fleur, just have fun.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction4_1_response_1","I say yes, she comes here, and then I ignore her because I have Traveler's to deal with day in and out! Ughhhhh!","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction4_1_response_2","You see, I don't need this. I get this enough from the part of my brain that yells this at me daily. I'm nervous about having fun!","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction4_2","It's hard to let go and enjoy the day when everything is screaming at you to not do that because you gotta make money, honey.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction4_3","Do you remember the last time you enjoyed the day? I don't and I'm tired of it. When Remy gets here, I am handing off Traveler's duties to my assistant. This place can survive without me for five days.","xxxx",,,,
"Fleur_interaction4_4","She's almost here! Two days from now she'll be here and I just lost my chef and our supplier is out of garlic, GARLIC, of all things! I'm just waiting for, nope, not gonna say it!","xxxx",,,,

"Milo_interaction1_2","How do you feel today? 'Good' is an action and not a state of being, so please answer in a manner that reflects how you actually feel._Myself, I am feeling joyful at the moment.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction1_3","My parents always taught me not to voice my opinion to someone's face, unless it's a good one._I found it's a good rule to live by, which is why I will not share what I think of your outfit, but man, it's hard.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction1_4","Did you know? Oni masks are usually reserved for traditional ceremonies and performances around Japan.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction1_5","Interacting with neurotypicals is just so tiring. I wish everyone could keep up during conversations, but sadly only a few can track with me._I could go on, but right now I am exhausted.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction1_6","You are the new chef in town? I've heard about you. Some people believe you are rather overblown and don't deserve the free restaurant._Others think you're fine. I don't know where I sit yet, but I'll come to a conclusion soon enough.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"Milo_interaction2_1_intro","You're a chef, have you ever tried to make a Japanese pancake?_The big fluffy ones that look like a cloud on a plate?","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction2_1_option_1","Yes, and they are a delight.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction2_1_option_2","No, I haven't yet.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction2_1_response_1","They are! I really love them with whipped cream and fresh blueberries. You have passed my test. Congrats.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction2_1_response_2","I am sorry to hear that. You have failed my test. For now I bid you adieu.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction2_2","I love traditional Japanese masks, though I think my favorites are Hannya masks._I guess we can say they look a bit weird and creepy, but to me they are extremely beautiful.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction2_3","To me, making something of quality is the point of making anything. I truly loathe the fast fashion you are wearing as it is both cheap and bad for the planet._Don't worry, you're not the only one who has terrible taste.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction2_4","I will go to Japan one day. I will.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction2_5","I don't have many friends in my life outside of Hasel and Thelio. Perhaps you will be my friend one day too. Have a good day, my future friend.","xxxx",,,,

"Milo_interaction3_1_option_1","Oh, uhhh, still working on that.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction3_1_option_2","I helped with some deliveries earlier.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction3_1_response_1","Remember, a community is only as good as the people who live in it. We should help others using our talents. I hope you cook something for someone in need today.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction3_1_response_2","Deliveries? I wasn't expecting that, I was expecting you cooking something for someone. Huh, that is curious.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction3_2","You know I own a clothing shop, but I don't order in blanks from some place online._I get my materials from local suppliers who make sure the stitches are solid. It's what allows my clothes to last longer than anyone elses.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction3_3","I will make my own clothing line at a scale that would help keep a lot of people warm, but also last a long time._It's hard to get quality and quantity, but I won't sacrifice the latter to make the former happen.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction3_4","Oni are formed when an evil person dies and goes to one of the Buddist hells._They come back as a demon to terrorize the living. In today's world, they are seen as a good luck charm that scares away bad luck.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction3_5","When it's raining, I tend to feel a little at ease, because the rhythm of it hitting the roof just helps me focus away from any troubling customers in my shop.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction3_6","In case you didn't know, Prisca is one of the most helpful people in town._She does so much for so many people. She helped me setup my store, so if you need things, be sure to look her up.","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"Milo_interaction4_1_intro","Hi friend! Tell me, do you have anyone special in your life? I'm asking because I am not seeking any sort of relationship with you._I inquire because I am curious about your life.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction4_1_option_1","No, I don't have the time for one.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction4_1_option_2","Yes, I have someone who is special to me.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction4_1_response_1","That is a shame to hear. Everyone needs someone, I believe, even if that person isn't a romantic interest to them, because no human is made to be alone.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction4_1_response_2","I'm glad to hear that (playername). I hope to one day have someone like that in my life. If she will have me that is, but we will see time goes forward.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction4_2","Making a friend is difficult for me because I am very honest with people._I think it will serve me well in a relationship because honesty is what's needed to make one work.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction4_3","I'm making an Oni mask at home. I hope to be able to use it at an upcoming festival._Now I just need a spiked club. Do you think that will get through security?","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction4_4","My parents have always treated me with respect and love. I am very lucky to have parents who are not condescending to me or treat me like a child._Respect is earned and they have earned mine.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction4_5","You know what I need right now? A boba tea from Hasel. When I'm off work let's go over there and have one._If you pick the wrong flavor I will let you know, okay?","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction4_6","Do you shop at Milk and Wheat frequently?_It doesn't sell anything special but my friend Thelio works there and I like to say hi. He's a good guy. ","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"Milo_interaction5_1_intro","Have you ever wondered about what life would be like if you were born 'normal'?","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction5_1_option_1","No one is normal, Milo.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction5_1_option_2","I really do wonder somedays.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction5_1_response_1","I don't envy or feel jealous about it, but I'd be curious to see what a day would be like as a neurotypical.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction5_1_response_2","When my mind is whirling, I don't get as much done, but that doesn't mean that I am not thinking about something._Usually I have my rubik's cube. It helps to move the pieces around in my hand when that happens.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction5_2","I really do like watching horror movies. They are hilarious, even though it is probably unintentional._But there's something about watching people scream and run for their lives from a masked killer makes me laugh.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction5_3","Each garment I make, I know it will live a long life, and as long as I know they are made of quality, then I am happy being a humble tailor.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction5_4","This place is full of people nowadays. I am not going to lie, not that I ever do, but I miss when it was quieter._Sure, less sales, but also, I could hear the ocean sometimes. Now, it's just constant chatter.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction5_5","I was walking to the shop today and saw a little kid with a baseball bat on rollerblades._I don't know why, but I am bothered by that image.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction5_6","Have you ever been to Milk and Wheat? It's a corner store in town._It not as good as the other stores around here but my friend Thelio works there and I like to visit him. He's a good guy. ","xxxx",,,,
,,,,,,
"Milo_interaction6_1_intro","Do you like horns or no horns for your oni mask? No judgement, just want to know.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction6_1_option_1","Horns please!","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction6_1_option_2","No horns, thank you.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction6_1_response_1","They do add a lot of drama to the mask, I agree.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction6_1_response_2","It's a clean look for the mask. I'll emphasize the teeth to create some drama.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction6_2","Making us a set of oni masks is something that I just popped into my head. I think it would be a lot of fun to have a set like that.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction6_3","Since we've been together, my brain has been on fire with ideas._I have drawn so many clothing doodles that I might need a new drawing pad soon.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction6_4","Free flowing ideas, a sense of warmth throughout the day, I see why people like being in a relationship._When I was single, I loved myself and my ideas, but having someone who also shares my dreams just makes things feel a bit warmer.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction6_5","If we're together for long enough, I'm sure the subject of marriage will come up._I don't think I need something so formal as a ceremony to feel like we're together forever, but if you do, let me know.","xxxx",,,,
"Milo_interaction6_6","I love you more than oni masks. I said it and I mean it. In my mind you are above that line._Which is a place that no one else has ever been to including my parents. I love them, but not as much as oni masks.","xxxx",,,,

"Aylin_interaction2_3","Did you know? Recent androids like me have a protective membrane against any moisture. It's why I can stand to be in the bathhouse all the time.","xxxx",,,,
"Aylin_interaction2_4","Looking out at White Ash Harbor, I am reminded that even though life is hard, it is worth living because we only have one chance at it.","xxxx",,,,
"Aylin_interaction2_5","Hate cuts both ways. For the people who perpetuate it, it changes their soul for the worse. For the people it's aimed at, it reduces them to a sub-human status._It is why letting go of it is a must if we're going to get anywhere as a community.","xxxx",,,,

"Aylin_interaction5_2","I have this memory, perhaps it was a dream? In it, I am a child walking around my family home and find my father working in the garage._He handed me a hammer and that's all I can remember. Memory or dream, I cherish it.","xxxx",,,,
"Aylin_interaction5_3","Each of our days that pass us by is a day that will never return. Most people will never cherish it because they are caught by time and their position in life._I know I speak from a position of privilege in that neither encroach upon my life.","xxxx",,,,
"Aylin_interaction5_4","My hope is that I will better the world around me._Those who wish to melt down the hills for the sake of profit do not understand the world they live in, for they think it is only for themselves.","xxxx",,,,
"Aylin_interaction5_5","I truly believe we need to hoist those who are of good character into leadership roles._If we don't give good models to base ourselves off of then I fear that the rot of society will grow ever deeper with each huckster in the spotlight.","xxxx",,,,
"Aylin_interaction5_6","I plan on venturing to your restaurant for an actual night out very soon now that I am not needed here every single day._If your restaurant is anything like the teahouse, then I believe I will be in for a grand time.","xxxx",,,,

"Aylin_interaction6_2","Where should we go? What should we see? It's been a very long time since I've walked around Billboard City._I wonder if it's improved or slid further into squalor? Regardless, a trip somewhere would be nice.","xxxx",,,,
"Aylin_interaction6_3","There is still a lot to do here in White Ash Harbor, but we must find time for ourselves, otherwise we will crumble._Work must not be the center of us. It will not hold if that's the case.","xxxx",,,,
"Aylin_interaction6_4","I love my bathhouse and you, I cannot ever choose between my two loves, and I hope I never have to.","xxxx",,,,
"Aylin_interaction6_5","If losing my human body meant that I got to meet you today, then it was a worthwhile exchange._Being alive as long as I have been and finding anything like us just felt more and more impossible with each passing year.","xxxx",,,,
"Aylin_interaction6_6","I am grateful for my time with you. I am grateful for my life here._Since I entered this shell, I thought I would stand alone in the shadows of life until the Earth stopped spinning._I don't feel that way anymore because of you.","xxxx",,,,

"Thelio_interaction1_2","I'm not on the clock yet, so I'm doing my own thing right now. Have a nice day.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction1_3","How's your day going? I read in one of my self-help books that asking questions is a great way to have a conversation._It's a simple principle, but it works.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction1_4","I am zonked! I unloaded four pallets' worth of inventory this morning. I might actually take a 15 minute break today.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction1_5","Looks like you're sticking around here, huh? As a lifelong citizen of this town, welcome.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction1_6","The library is a great first stop if you're new in town. They carry many books that cover many topics and it's a chill spot. Go.","xxxx",,,,

"Thelio_interaction2_2","Do you meditate? If you don't, you really should. I just started doing it about last year I think and it's been very nice._I don't believe in all of the heal powers nonsense, but I know it has helped me a lot mentally.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction2_3","It's hard to remember in the heat of the moment to take a breath and center yourself. Rage is a fire that feels good to burn inside of sometimes.","xxxx",,,,

"Thelio_interaction3_2","If you're wondering how I got these scars, it wasn't because of a shaving accident.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction3_3","I used to get into fights, a lot of fights, as a teenager. I took every negative comment as a critique against my character. I . . . I really messed up a lot of people.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction3_4","Did you hear that a new sewing shop opened in town? I am going to head straight there after work._Would rather pour money into local businesses than Black Forest online marketplace.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction3_5","Anger often comes from trying to control something that is uncontrollable._My past is beyond me now and learning to let that go has been a long process. But I got today and today has been good.","xxxx",,,,

"Thelio_interaction4_1_intro","What really changed my perspective on life was my grandfather. He . . . he died. Before going, he set me straight because he . . ._. . .He saw what my choices had done to my life.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction4_1_option_1","Sometimes getting some perspective helps.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction4_1_option_2","He loved you enough to say the hard truths.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction4_1_response_1","Right?! If he hadn't done that, I wouldn't be where I am right now. Not that this life is anything to brag about . . . but it could be worse. A lot worse.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction4_1_response_2","Fact is, when he told me that I was pissed, and didn't talk to him until his last day in the hospital._Anger makes you do stupid things.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction4_2","One thing I do to help get the anger out is to bake bread. Kneading the dough, hitting it, that force gives it shape and makes something from the energy you give it._It's better than therapy, something I should be doing still, ha!","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction4_3","If you really want to try baking, come by my place when Milo is there too. We usually do baking nights on Thursdays.","xxxx",,,,

"Thelio_interaction5_1_option_2","You need to be open to it.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction5_1_response_1","That's rather pessimistic . . . I think you're wrong, but only because I have changed myself . . . At least, I thought so.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction5_1_response_2","Yeah, I think you have to want it. You know something isn't working, but you can't see it yourself. You need that outside force to really guide you through it.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction5_2","Changing your mind is one of the easiest and hardest things to do because it means that you were probably wrong about somethings._And people hate being wrong.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction5_3","A few years ago I was walking to school and saw a stop sign laying on the ground. It had blood and dirt on it._I dunno what happened, but I always hoped everyone was okay.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction5_4","Something I started doing to get out some anger was taking kick-boxing classes._I would slam the full body bags with everything I had. Problem was it didn't do enough for me. I had to re-route my anger too, not just release it.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction5_5","I see people day in and out and I know where most are coming from and it isn't always a good place._I hope when they hear me say 'Have a good day' they take it to heart. An act of kindness goes far, even if it's just a 'Have a nice day.'","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction5_6","Just an fyi, don't head over to East Beach. It's a spot that's known for bad vibes and bad things happening at it at night. Trust me.","xxxx",,,,

"Thelio_interaction6_1_option_2","I'm glad you reciprocated my gladness.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction6_1_response_1","Just, with everything that has gone on in my life, I never thought anyone would have wanted me. I guess all that onion work has paid off. Ha!","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction6_1_response_2","I'm glad that you're glad that we're in a constant state of gladness together.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction6_2","I am going to work harder than anyone else to make sure we have a future together that is in the black and pulling in savings at 10%.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction6_3","Us, this couldn't have happened unless I cared about myself first. Does that make sense?_Because if I didn't care about myself, love myself, then I would've been bashing brains in on East Beach for credits still. It feels good to be here.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction6_4","When I have my own business, we will dine in places with chandeliers and a dress code. I promise you.","xxxx",,,,
"Thelio_interaction6_5","You have no idea how inspiring it is that someone as successful as you was even interested in me._I'm not going to compete against you, that's not the point, but I hope our relationship will push us both to be our best.","xxxx",,,,

"Damien_interaction4_2","Having had many implants installed and having had many removal surguries due to implant rejection almost drove me mad, man._When your brain is wired for vision and is given it and has it taken away, it's rough.","xxxx",,,,

"Koa_interaction1_2","I'm trying out a new dish at the restaurant. I've been testing it for months and I'm only letting my most cultured clientle try it as it involves liquid nitrogen.","xxxx",,,,
"Koa_interaction1_3","When I get a free moment, I'm going to do some pottery. Clay helps to strengthen my hands and let's allows my mind to focus on something that isn't food a while. It's relaxing and stressful at the same time, the perfect hobby.","xxxx",,,,
"Koa_interaction1_4","Remember, this restaurant is your shot and it will rely on not only your creativity but also your business sense. Good luck.","xxxx",,,,

"Koa_interaction2_4","My father told me once that friends should only be counted on one hand. I believe this to be true because friendships are a give and take system and if too many people are taking from you then there isn't anything left for yourself.","xxxx",,,,
"Koa_interaction2_5","I'm a little tired, (playername). Been putting in massive hours at the restaurant, but it has to be a success. Too many people are counting on me and I will not let them down. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get more work done.","xxxx",,,,

"Koa_interaction4_3","If I am going to make my mental health a priority in my life, I knew I had to offer my employees the same benefits. To be a leader is to be responsible not only to my well being but my employees as well.","xxxx",,,,
"Koa_interaction4_4","I'm going to put my mental health plan to a vote. If my employees want this benefits package, then we'll have to send money we would spend on bonuses toward it. Since it would effect all of us, we all need to vote on it. Wish me luck, (playername).","xxxx",,,,

"Casteau_interaction1_1","Hello, my friend! It's great seeing you. I hope everything is going well so far. I'll see you later.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction1_2","I found this little shop on the docks that has some of the freshest fish I have ever seen. I've forgotten how good fresh fish is since in Billboard City it's usually shipped frozen.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction1_3","Talking to the people in town, it's crazy how much the people here have shifted culturally. A lot of young folks and that's amazing because it means the city will continue to live.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction1_4","When all is said and done, we have only our stories, which is why I like to chat with Bowie so much. We trade a lot of stories!","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction1_5","Old people, like myself, usually find themselves lamenting over how things used to be and I hate that line of thinking. Unless we are trying to fix a broken system, judging what others do is just complaining and I don't have time for complaining.","xxxx",,,,

"Casteau_interaction2_1_intro","(playername), how's things? Not just with Le Sequoia, but how are you doing?","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction2_1_option_1","I don't know, I think I'm okay. Just getting a lot done at the restaurant.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction2_1_option_2","I've picked up a few hobbies since arriving in town. I recently got into fishing and it's been fantastic!","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction2_1_response_1","You shouldn't waste away inside the restaurant. Life is more than just work.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction2_1_response_2","Fantastic! See! Billboard City has a lot going on in it, but you're not going to find something like that there.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction2_2","Life is a crazy path to follow. It leads toward an end one day, but hopefully you've seen some sights along the way. In the end, that's all we could ask for.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction2_3","I've been thinking, a dangerous pastime, I know, but your life isn't just for you. We live among others who lives are just as important as yours. A society is only as good as the people who inhabit it. That's it.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction2_4","The wind here is fresh, albeit, a little fishy, but that's part of the charm too.","xxxx",,,,

"Casteau_interaction3_1_option_2","I've noticed some things seem to be improving.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction3_1_response_1","A town needs everyone in it to help it move toward a better tomorrow. If you don't think you're making a difference by being here then you need to get out and walk around more.","xxxx",,,,

"Casteau_interaction3_2","Walking around here, I get to relive some of the happiest moments of my life. Nostalgia is a strong emotion, but to stay in the warmth of its glow would mean the death of my personal growth.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction3_3","My knee is really acting up today. Please, I implore you, to wear good shoes now! It will only help you out later on in life.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction3_4","I went for a walk along the docks today and I didn't see Bowie. I thought something had happened, but no, he was just eating lunch in a different spot. When you get old, you tend to think the worst when something new happens.","xxxx",,,,
"Casteau_interaction3_5","Just heading back from my yoga session! I have aches still, yes, but they hurt a lot less because of the yoga. Now, I just need some stretchy pants! Haha!","xxxx",,,,

"Otto_interaction2_1_option_1","I mean, you're asking me a question, aren't you? I didn't make you do that.","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction2_1_option_2","Because I wonder why you hate me so much.","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction2_1_response_1","I am asking because you seem to constantly find me and I really don't have the time for you.","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction2_1_response_2","Hate means that I am always thinking about you and want to do something violent towards you because I have such a strong negative feeling toward you. I don't hate you because I don't even think about you when you're not pestering me.","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction2_2","I'll have to have Gale grade those papers for the introductory classes and . . . WHAT DO YOU WANT?!","xxxx",,,,

"Otto_interaction2_4","I want to have time to myself. I run an entire culinary institute, so will you please leave me alone so I can have some quiet for a bloody moment!","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction2_5","For someone who walked away from my kitchen and my teachings, you seem awfully clingy because you keep bothering me.","xxxx",,,,

"Otto_interaction3_1_option_2","I thought you didn't care about whether people quit your kitchen or not?","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction3_1_response_1","Because! Because . . . because when people quit I don't see them anymore. They failed and are gone. You, you just don't know when to quit!","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction3_1_response_2","I don't, but those people usually leave my sight forever. They don't go on in the industry and if they do they stay at the appropriate level, dishwasher!","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction3_2","Upstarts don't last and they certainly aren't remembered beyond their 15 minutes in the spotlight.","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction3_3","When will you learn that I don't want to talk to you and have zero INTEREST in having a conversation beyond me just yelling at you?!","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction3_4","Let's try something new, shall we? You go one direction, I go another, and you vanish from my existence forever.","xxxx",,,,

"Otto_interaction4_1_option_2","Is someone forever spitting in your cereal and putting you in a bad mood?","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction4_1_response_1","I . . .how dare . . . just, leave me alone!","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction4_1_response_2","My cereal is eggs, bacon, toast, and a cup of coffee and is better than yours! I wake in a great mood every day, so stop being bitter about my life!","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction4_2","I've got TA's that have grading to do based on my reactions to students dishes, so please, move out of my way.","xxxx",,,,

"Otto_interaction4_4","You are showing a lot of . . . promise, (playername). Have a good day.","xxxx",,,,
"Otto_interaction4_5","You should know that I will forever hold you quitting my kitchen in my heart, but I'd be an idiot to not see what my eyes are telling me. You're a good chef.","xxxx",,,,

"Aylin_quest_23034_1_Poor","That was simply horrendous. Is this how you run Le Sequoia? Seeing how far you have come, I think not._The grand opening isn't far. If this is how the grand opening turns out, there will be . . . repercussions . . .","xxxx",,,,
"Nadjet_quest_23034_1_Amazing","Hey, you are alright (playername). That was some delicious grub. Maybe you can cook a private meal for me sometime huh?_Uhhhh . . . Joking boss! I'm joking of course!","xxxx",,,,

"Casteau_quest_23034_1_Poor","It wasn't good (playername). That's the truth. But that's ok. Remember what I said (playername)?_Finding your signature takes a long road of failures to achieve. If you are the chef I know you to be, you can fix this.","xxxx",,,,

"Aylin_cutscene_23034_2","Fishing is what made this town, tourism helped it grow, but the Peony Bathhouse is what held it all together._It was the sinew of White Ash Harbor because it's where people come to relax, chat, and know one another.","xxxx",,,,
